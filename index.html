      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a husband, father, and coding student at UTSA coding bootcamps!</p>

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Going to the gym, yard work, and grilling.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Starting pitcher for the Texas Rangers</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Live Oak, which is on the NE Side of San Antonio.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm looking for a stable career that can provide challenges, freedom, creative flexibility, and pays well.  
        computers and coding are the way of the future and I would like to be able to help my daughter understand
        this language as well.  There's something really cool about developing something behind the scenes and seeing
        it pop up in a window in a browser as your creative masterpiece.
